## The Moldable Development Environment
[Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com) is the Moldable Development environment. It empowers you to make systems explainable through experiences tailored for each problem.

## Get started

### Install and run
Simply download: https://gtoolkit.com/download.
The download is a self contained installation made of a Glamorous Toolkit image, a virtual machine, and a few other resources and libraries.
Now, just run the executable.
- On Mac: `GlamorousToolkit.app`
- On Windows: `.\bin\GlamorousToolkit.exe`
- On Linux: `./bin/GlamorousToolkit`

### Take a tour
Glamorous Toolkit was developed following Moldable Development, and it offers extensive opportunities to learn about itself. Start with a tour through the built-in book to get an overview of the breadth of possibilities.

Or explore online:
- [Read the book](https://book.gtoolkit.com).
- [Watch GT in 7' video series](https://youtu.be/-vFwfwy5WZA?list=PLfrs5bwLJOoAaHvQGSLeKpHWmFuZXPUTJ).

### Pick a problem you care about
Pick a problem you care about. Pick a problem you care about. We cannot stress this enough.

Why? Because the essence of Moldable Development is about adapting the environment to match the context. If you do not have a deep context, you cannot evaluate what contextual tools do for you. Pick a problem you care about.

What kind of problems? There can be many. Out of the box, you can explore:
- Explore a GraphQL or REST API
- Analyze unknown data
- Discover and model a domain
- Assess an existing system
- Document a system
- Build system specific editors

Read about more examples in the built-in book.
### Go beyond the technology
Glamorous Toolkit is an environment that shows how the experience of programming can be, but ultimately it's still just a piece of technology. Moldable Development is more than technology. It requires new skills. But even more important is that Moldable Development introduces a new feedback loop that has far reaching consequences, both on the technical and the business level. Use the technology, but focus on learning how to think about programming anew.
